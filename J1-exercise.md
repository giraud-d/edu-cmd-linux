# Step 0

Get a terminal


# Step 1 : Morning

## A) Create that tree map

* `/home/<user>/CESI/2024-cmd-linux/exercices/J1/instructions` (as a file)
* `/home/<user>/CESI/2024-cmd-linux/exercices/J1/my-list-of-cmd` (as a file)
* `/home/<user>/CESI/2024-cmd-linux/exercices/J2`
* `/home/<user>/CESI/2024-cmd-linux/exercices/J3`
* `/home/<user>/CESI/2024-cmd-linux/note-pad`
* `/home/<user>/CESI/2024-cmd-linux/note-pad/cmd-utils` (as a file)
* `/home/<user>/CESI/2024-cmd-linux/note-pad/personal-notes.txt` (as a file)

Then list each folders (with 2 differents cmd)

TIPS :
